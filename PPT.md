# Phase 1: Problem Identification & Solution Overview

---

## 1. Problem

Storing and sharing files over the internet is currently centralized, making data vulnerable to:
- Unauthorized access and privacy breaches
- Censorship or data loss (single-point failure)
- Malware/ransomware propagation via unscanned files
- Lack of verifiable, on-chain audit trails for access and sharing

---

## 2. Root of the Problem

- **Centralized Control:** Most cloud storage and sharing platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) rely on a central authority, creating a single point of failure.
- **Limited Transparency:** Users cannot audit file access, sharing, or integrity independently; they must trust the provider.
- **Malware Risks:** Files are often shared without automated, transparent security scans, risking spread of malicious content.
- **No On-Chain Permissions:** Current solutions rarely leverage blockchain for tamper-proof, programmable access control.

## 3. Solution

A decentralized file storage and sharing platform that:
- Stores encrypted files across multiple IPFS nodes, eliminating central points of failure
- Uses blockchain smart contracts to manage file metadata, access permissions, and an immutable sharing history
- Integrates automated malware/threat scanning (e.g., VirusTotal) before files are shared or downloaded
- Provides verifiable, on-chain audit trails for all file actions

---

## 4. How It Works

1. **Upload:** User encrypts a file locally and uploads it to the decentralized storage network (IPFS).
2. **Scan:** The file is automatically scanned using a threat intelligence API (like VirusTotal).
3. **Register:** The fileâ€™s metadata (CID, owner, permissions, scan status) is recorded in a smart contract on the blockchain.
4. **Share:** The owner can grant/revoke access to others by updating permissions on-chain.
5. **Access:** Recipients can view scan status and, if permitted, download/decrypt the file from IPFS.
6. **Audit:** All actions (upload, share, access) are logged on-chain for transparency.

## 5. Existing Solutions

- **Centralized Cloud Storage:** Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive
  - Pros: User-friendly, integrated, scalable
  - Cons: Centralized, privacy risks, limited transparency, no on-chain controls
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS, Filecoin, Storj, Sia
  - Pros: Distributed, censorship-resistant
  - Cons: No built-in access control or threat scanning, poor sharing/audit UX
- **Blockchain File Sharing:** Some platforms use smart contracts for storage pointers (e.g., Arweave, Ocean Protocol)
  - Pros: Tamper-proof records
  - Cons: Usually lack integrated threat scanning or granular permissions

---

## 6. Our Suggested Solution

**A hybrid decentralized platform combining:**
- Multi-node IPFS for encrypted, distributed file storage
- 3-4 blockchain nodes (Ethereum testnet) running smart contracts for:
  - File registration (CID, owner, scan status)
  - On-chain access/permission management
  - Immutable sharing/audit logs
- Node.js backend orchestrator for:
  - Automated threat scanning using VirusTotal API
  - Secure API key management and scan result relaying
- Frontend (React.js) for seamless user experience

---

## 7. Benefits

- **Censorship Resistance:** No central authority can block or delete files.
- **Privacy & Security:** Files are encrypted; permissions are enforced on-chain.
- **Transparency:** All actions are auditable via the blockchain.
- **Threat Protection:** Automated malware scanning before sharing/download.
- **User Control:** Owners manage access directly, not through a third party.
- **Extensible:** New features (analytics, more scan engines, other chains) can be added easily.
